            <p>The late Felix de Wolfe founded Felix de Wolfe Theatrical and Literary Agency and his hallmarks as an
                agent were his talent for friendship, his endless courtesy and his patience. Many of his clients became
                close personal friends, and his reputation throughout the industry was as a fair but charmingly
                effective negotiator. Clients’ careers were, in many cases, a lifetime’s responsibility. Ultimately it was
                his solicitude and professional charm, combined with a brilliant instinct for matching talent to
                popular taste that made him and his agency stand out. These rare qualities and ethos are what we
                continue to embrace and uphold.
