            some of the country’s most talented performers and creatives, both in the UK and globally. We pride
            ourselves on the quality of our client base which includes actors, presenters, directors,
            choreographers, composers and authors, and on the dedicated level of service we deliver. We are
            members of the Personal Managers Association (PMA), Women in Film and Television (WFTV) and

            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>The late Felix de Wolfe founded Felix de Wolfe Theatrical and Literary Agency and his hallmarks as an
            agent were his talent for friendship, his endless courtesy and his patience. Many of his clients became
            close personal friends, and his reputation throughout the industry was as a fair but charmingly
            effective negotiator. Clients’ careers were, in many cases, a lifetime’s responsibility. Ultimately it was
            his solicitude and professional charm, combined with a brilliant instinct for matching talent to
            popular taste that made him and his agency stand out. These rare qualities and ethos are what we
            continue to embrace and uphold.
