            <p>Felix de Wolfe has two agents, Caroline de Wolfe and Wendy Scozzaro. They are ably assisted by Rob
                Hughes, who originally trained as an actor and subsequently joined the team in October 2016.
                Caroline joined the business in 1986, and she took the helm in 2004. Working alongside her father for
                over 20 years, Caroline inherited his passion for the business as well as his values and strong business
                ethics.

                Wendy joined Caroline in 1999 and her shared commitment to personal service and dedication to
                their clients is at the heart of what makes them so successful, along with their well-earned reputations
                for hard-work and professionalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Caroline and Wendy continue to grow the Agency together, and to develop and strengthen their
                industry relationships at home and abroad, acting as strong facilitators for the careers of all their
                clients.
